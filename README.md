# Health_Insurance_Cross_Sell_Prediction (GPU Required)

Overview
--------

This project was designed to assist our client, an Insurance company, in expanding their product range by introducing Vehicle Insurance to their Health Insurance customer base. Our primary objective was to develop a predictive analytics model that could effectively identify potential customers for this new insurance offering.

Objectives

*   **Marketing Efficiency**: Enhance the client's marketing strategies through targeted communication.

Methodology
-----------

### Data Analysis

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted a comprehensive EDA to understand customer demographics, vehicle details, and insurance policy specifics.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Refined and transformed data to be more effective for predictive modeling.

### Predictive Modeling

*   **Model Development**: Built a machine learning model to analyze customer attributes such as age, gender, region, vehicle age, damage history, and insurance policy details.
*   **Model Validation**: Ensured the accuracy and reliability of the model through rigorous validation processes.

Outcomes
--------

*   **Pattern Recognition**: Identified key patterns and relationships that correlate with a customer's likelihood to buy Vehicle Insurance.
